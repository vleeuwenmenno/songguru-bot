      Hi guild owner, 

      I encountered a small issue, we tried to create the "SongGuru Moderator" role but this failed due to a lack of permissions. 
      I tried to create this role because the role is used to allow members that have this role to edit guild preferences using the `/settings` command.

      You can solve this issue in 2 ways, add the "Manage Roles" permission to the bot in your guild or manually create a new role with the exact name "SongGuru Moderator".
      
      If you have any further questions or suggestions, feel free to DM <@!175487814274777088>.
      Alternatively, you can join our Discord guild for support: [SongGuru Support Guild](https://discord.gg/XAxAh2CrNZ)

      Have a nice day!

      Greetings from <@!175487814274777088> and SongGuru! :wave:

      Hi guild owner,

      Thanks for adding SongGuru to your guild!

      To get started, in your guild use the command `/settings` to get a link to edit your personal and guild preferences.
      Don't worry only members with the SongGuru Moderator role will be able to adjust guild preferences.
